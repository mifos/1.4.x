
Setup requirements to execute Mifos Selenium bvt tests:
1. Firefox 1.5.0 or 2.0.0
2. Selenium IDE: http://selenium-ide.openqa.org/
3. Deployed instance of mifos.  All tests use "mifos" user account.
4. Base database created by calling ant build_db.


Each selenium test assumes the user is logged onto system.  

The test "_FirstLogin.html" will perform a simple login, so when all tests are run as a test suite that test will execute first.

Steps to run a set of Selenium IDE tests as a single test suite can be found on at mifos.org:
